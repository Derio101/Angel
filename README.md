Code that compiles python script into an EXE file (Windows Application), 
It has a clean and simple GUI that allows you to simply select your script and select an icon then bamn you get an app, 
its alright for now but get ready for more versions and updates.\=
I wrote this code because i wanted to solve a problem using code for the first time in a long time,
I felt that some users who are not tech survey would want to indulge in github code but its sometimes not easy to do so.
So, i wanted others to use my code without having to run it in vs code and install libraries.
So i mad ethis, my friend says that there is omething similar out there but to be honest there always is something similar,
what makes this great is its coming from my head and has not been influenced by any existing program so lets see how different or similar they will be.
Actually i need to include the EXE.
